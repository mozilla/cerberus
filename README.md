cerberus [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/cerberus.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/cerberus)
========

Automatic [alert system](https://alerts.telemetry.mozilla.org) for [telemetry](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/) histograms.

Cerberus detects changes in the distribution of histograms (histogram regressions), and posts alerts for these to the [medusa](https://github.com/mozilla/medusa) alert service.

Cerberus is also responsible for sending out email reminders for histograms that are expiring in upcoming versions.

Development and deployment
--------------------------

To start hacking on your local machine:
```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

To deploy cerberus on AWS:
```
ansible-playbook ansible/deploy.yml -i ansible/inventory [ --private-key /path/to/mykey.pem ]
```

Note that the deployment requires [medusa](https://github.com/mozilla/medusa) to be deployed.


Code Overview
-------------

`run.sh` is a shell script that will set up all the dependencies, then do a full run of the Cerberus detectors. These are the components used in the script:

* `exporter/export.js` downloads the histogram evolutions from the [v4 aggregates API](https://github.com/mozilla/python_mozaggregator).
  * This script uses [telemetry-next-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/telemetry-next-node) in order to access Unified Telemetry data.
* The code for detecting regressions lives in `alert/alert.py`. This file is intended to be run as a script.
  * This is a script that reads histogram definitions from `Histograms.json` (which is downloaded automatically by `run.sh`).
  * Detected regressions are written out to `dashboard/regressions.json`.
* `alert/post.py` reads in new regressions from `dashboard/regressions.json`, and posts alerts to Medusa with this data.
  * Posting new alerts to Medusa is done using `alert/poster.py`.
  * By default, the Medusa server URL is set to `localhost:8080` - it expects to be on the same machine as the Medusa server. This can be changed by editing `alert/post.py`.
* `alert/expiring.py` is the histogram expiry detector - it notifies people via email when histograms are expiring soon.
  * Some configurable number of days before the versions where histograms are set to expire, it sends out emails using Amazon SES to watchers, and the dev-telemetry-alerts mailing list.
* `dashboard/` contains a debugging/development dashboard for viewing detected regressions. It is intended to be hosted via GitHub Pages or a similar static hosting solution.
